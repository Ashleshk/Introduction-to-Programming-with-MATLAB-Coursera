Write a function called get_distance that accepts two character vector inputs 
representing the names of two cities. The function returns the distance between 
them as an output argument called distance.

function distance = get_distance(a,b)
[~,text,raw] = xlsread('Distances.xlsx');
for i=2:size(raw,1)
    if strcmp(text{i,1}, a)
        break
    end
end
if i>=size(raw,1)
    distance=-1;
else
    for j=2:size(raw,2)
        if strcmp(text{1,j}, b)
            distance=raw{i,j};
            break
        end
    end
    if j>=size(raw,2)
        distance = -1;
    end
end

distance = get_distance('Seattle, WA','Miami, FL')

ASSIGNMENT: TEXT FILES Write a function called char_counter that counts the number
 of a certain character in a text file. The function takes two input arguments, 
fname, a char vector of the filename and character, the char it counts in the file.

function charnum=char_counter(fname,character)
fid=fopen(fname,'rt');
if fid<0 || ~ischar(character) %checks if the file is valid and if it is a visible character or not using OR operator
    charnum=-1;
    return;
end
x=fscanf(fid,'%c'); %fscanf scans the entire file and stores it in a column vector x
charnum=length(find(x==character)); %find() finds all the characters that are required and stores the indices in a vector. The length of this vector gives the number of characters
end

type('simple.txt')

charnum = char_counter('simple.txt','a')

charnum = char_counter('Frankenstein-by-Shelley.txt','?')
